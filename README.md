# PreventingLoggingOut
This simple software makes a mouse move and a left click each 10 seconds. I used it to avoid logging out from a Virtual Machine but can be used for more other aspects.

The MouseNeverStopAndClickpy.py is the python script where the pyinput package is used.
The MouseNeverStopAndclickpy.exe is the windows executable fiel created with pyinstaller.

Hope you enjoy my easy script.
