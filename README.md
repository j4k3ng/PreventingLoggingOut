# PreventingLoggingOut
This simple software makes a little mouse movement each 10 seconds (the program will start moving the mouse around the actual coursor position). I used it to avoid logging out from a Virtual Machine but can be used for more other aspects like in gaming.

The MouseNeverStop.py is the python script where the pyinput package is used.
The MouseNeverStop.exe is the windows executable fiel created with pyinstaller.


=========================================================================== READ THIS ==========================================================================================

To use the software simply double click on the .exe file (if you are on Windows). A command windows will open and the mouse will move around the actual coursor position. If you wanna stop the software type ctrl + c on the command windows. 


Hope you enjoy my easy script
